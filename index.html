            <h2 class="titles"><em>A Bloody History</em></h2>
            <p>However unknown he was previously, however, he has shown himself to be a dangerous individual.  Sources in the IIA have confirmed that this one-time moisture farmer fired the torpedoes that destroyed the first Death Star&reg;, killing untold numbers of valiant Imperial soldiers.  This reporter's heart goes out to the families of these lost heroes.</p>

            <h2 class="titles"><em>A Holy War?</em></h2>
            <p>Making his rampage even more terrifying, this news outlet has learned that his attacks are not solely political, but motivated by religious zealotry.  Skywalker has apparently adopted the outlawed religion know as the "Jedi", a radical holy order, which was once thought eradicated at the end of the Clone Wars.</p>.

            <h2 class="titles"><em>Goodbye, Our Beloved Leader</em></h2>
            <p>Whatever his motivation, his actions have led to the dimming of one of the great stars of unificaction in the galaxy.  Gaze once more upon the face of the frail, but wise leader we have lost this day, and weep with us.  Try to remember him as he was, the Supreme Chancellor, guardian of peace in a time of struggles.</p>
